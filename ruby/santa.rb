# Your class should have three instance methods:
class Santa

	def initialize 
	end 
# A speak method that will print "Ho, ho, ho! Haaaappy holidays!" (Santa has been working on being more inclusive.)
	def speak 
	puts "Ho, ho, ho! Haaaappy holidays!" 
	end
# An eat_milk_and_cookies method that takes a cookie type (example: "snickerdoodle") as a parameter and prints "That was a good <type of cookie here>!"
def eat_milk_cookies( cookie_type )
	puts "That was a good #{cookie_type}!"
end 

# An initialize method that prints "Initializing Santa instance ...".
# Add a bit of code below your class declaration to check that you're able to initialize a Santa instance and call its methods.
