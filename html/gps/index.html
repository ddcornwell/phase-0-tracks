	There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?  -->

Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in language.Semantic elements are elements with a meaning. 

<!-- Which ones do you see as most useful?  -->

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: div and span - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: form, table, and img - Clearly defines its content.

<!-- What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? -->

yes there is a order...

<!-- What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? -->

<!-- What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? -->.

i would say that the hard part was not having a paring with some one. there a lot of tag and how to use them the right way like a rowspan. I knew what i did but forgot where to put it.
